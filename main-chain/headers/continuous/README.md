### Continuous Headers Test Cases

The headers, which in the current directory, are used for testing the bitcoin continuous headers.

Let's denote the interval of Bitcoin difficulty change to be $I_{\mathnormal{change}}$ [^1],
then the height of the first header in each test case should be $k \cdot I_{\mathnormal{change}}$,
where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
